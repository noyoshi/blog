My name is Noah Yoshida and as of Fall of 2018, I am Junior Computer Science
major at the University of Notre Dame. 

In highschool I wanted to major in architecture, but after discovering that I
did not enjoy drawing as much as I thought I did, I switched to computer science
before starting my first year of college. I have been programming for about a
year now, and have loved every minute of it. I am always on the lookout for new
and interesting things to learn in the realm of technology and programming, and
have tried to expose myself to a wide variety of areas. I have experience in
full stack web development, natural language processing research, and various
Linux related topics. 

In my free time I enjoy customizing my Linux machine, playing games both of the
electronic and analog kind with friends, and learning more about tech, art,
architecture, or practicing my Japanese. 

The username Silver came from the first video game I ever played - Pokemon
Silver. I did not know how to set a custom name in the game, so I always used
the default name - Silver. That has stuck and now I use it for many online
accounts. I also once was a pretty good Pokemon TCG player, but those days are
over (but who knows, maybe I will try to make a comeback?).

I am currently looking for a part time (20 hr/week) internship in Silicon Valley
for the Spring, and a full time internship there for next Summer. Feel free to
reach out to me via email or LinkedIn if you would like!
