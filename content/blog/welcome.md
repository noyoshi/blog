Hello world!

Quick intro in case you haven't been over to the about me yet. My name is Noah
Yoshida and I am currently a computer science student at the University of Notre
Dame. I am interested in a wide variety of things, and have experience in full
stack web development, NLP research, and various UNIX/Linux related topics. I
enjoy customizing my Linux machine, so many posts will be how to use various
programs or edit various settings in Linux to make it more aesthetic,
productive, and user friendly. I am also an avid gamer, both of the electronic
and analog kind, and could very well post topics about that as well. Finally,
outside of tech, I am interested in architecture, design, and Japanese, and
might make a misc section for those topics. We shall see. 

Until next time!

-Noah
